2023-09-14 – Only one use case narrative, no diagram. Seems like you are confusing requirements and use cases. You should NOT be writing code at this stage, or be prepared to throw it away.
2023-09-22 – Continued work on use case document, good.
2023-09-28 - No upload of architecture design. No repository activity this week. No headers on code.
2023-10-04 - You updated your architecture design, which is good. BUT you did not commit any coding standards which was required by the lab last week.

2023-10-12 - You have uploaded .DS-Store to your repository in several directories. This is a derived file that does not belong in the repository. Suggests to me that you were using a GUI for the lab exercise...

Your lab report mostly seems copied from my assignment instruction introduction...

No other code development over the past week.
